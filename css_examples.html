            Cuttlefish or cuttles[2] are marine molluscs of the order Sepiida. They belong to the class Cephalopoda,
            which also includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the
            cuttlebone, which is used for control of buoyancy.

            Cuttlefish have large, W-shaped pupils, eight arms, and two tentacles furnished with denticulated suckers,
            with which they secure their prey. They generally range in size from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in), with the
            largest species, Sepia apama, reaching 50 cm (20 in) in mantle length and over 10.5 kg (23 lb) in mass.[3]

            Cuttlefish eat small molluscs, crabs, shrimp, fish, octopus, worms, and other cuttlefish. Their predators
            include dolphins, sharks, fish, seals, seabirds, and other cuttlefish. The average life expectancy of a
            cuttlefish is about 1â€“2 years. Studies are said to indicate cuttlefish to be among the most intelligent
            invertebrates.[4] Cuttlefish also have one of the largest brain-to-body size ratios of all invertebrates.[4]

            The "cuttle" in cuttlefish comes from the Old English name for the species, cudele, which may be cognate
            with the Old Norse koddi (cushion) and the Middle Low German Kudel (rag).[5] The Greco-Roman world valued
            the cuttlefish as a source of the unique brown pigment the creature releases from its siphon when it is
            alarmed. The word for it in both Greek and Latin, sepia, now refers to the reddish-brown color sepia in
            English.

        <h3>Fossil record</h3>
        <p>
            The earliest fossils of cuttlefish are from the Cretaceous period.[6][7] represented by Ceratisepia from the
            Late Maastrichtian-Paleocene.[8] Whether the earlier Trachyteuthis is assigned to this order, or to the
            Octopodiformes, remains unclear.[9]

        <h3>Range and habitat</h3>
        <p>
            The family Sepiidae, which contains all cuttlefish, inhabits tropical and temperate ocean waters. They are
            mostly shallow-water animals, although they are known to go to depths of about 600 m (2,000 ft).[10] They
            have
            an unusual biogeographic pattern: they are present along the coasts of East and South Asia, Western Europe,
            and
            the Mediterranean, as well as all coasts of Africa and Australia, but are totally absent from the Americas.
            By
            the time the family evolved, ostensibly in the Old World, the North Atlantic possibly had become too cold
            and
            deep for these warm-water species to cross.[11] The common cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis), is found in the
            Mediterranean, North and Baltic seas, although populations may occur as far south as South Africa. They are
            found in sublittoral depths, between the low tide line and the edge of the continental shelf, to about 180 m
            (600 ft).[12] The cuttlefish is listed under the Red List category of "least concern" by the IUCN Red List
            of
            Threatened Species. This means that while some over-exploitation of the marine animal has occurred in some
            regions due to large-scale commercial fishing, their wide geographic range prevents them from being too
            threatened. Ocean acidification, however, caused largely by higher levels of carbon dioxide emitted into the
            atmosphere, is cited as a potential threat.[13]
